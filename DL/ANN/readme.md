# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 📖 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the major challenges faced by banks and financial institutions.  
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is *likely to leave the bank (churn)* or *stay loyal, using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)* model trained on a churn dataset.

The project is divided into *three major parts*:
1.⁠ ⁠ANN Model Training  
2.⁠ ⁠Customer Churn Prediction  
3.⁠ ⁠Model Deployment using Streamlit  

This solution helps banks take *proactive decisions* to retain customers by identifying high-risk churn cases.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
To build a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on demographic and financial details such as:
•⁠  ⁠Credit score
•⁠  ⁠Age
•⁠  ⁠Balance
•⁠  ⁠Tenure
•⁠  ⁠Number of products
•⁠  ⁠Active membership
•⁠  ⁠Estimated salary

## ⚙️ Part 1: ANN Model Training
•⁠  ⁠Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, feature selection)
•⁠  ⁠Splitting data into training and testing sets
•⁠  ⁠Building an ANN with:
  - Input layer
  - Hidden layers
  - Output layer (Binary Classification)
•⁠  ⁠Model evaluation using accuracy and loss
•⁠  ⁠Saving the trained model for deployment

---

## 🔮 Part 2: Customer Churn Prediction
•⁠  ⁠Takes customer input data
•⁠  ⁠Applies the same preprocessing used during training
•⁠  ⁠Predicts whether the customer will:
  - *Stay Loyal*
  - *Exit (Churn)*

---

## 🚀 Part 3: Model Deployment using Streamlit
•⁠  ⁠Interactive web interface for real-time prediction
•⁠  ⁠Users can input customer details using sliders and dropdowns
•⁠  ⁠Displays churn prediction instantly
•⁠  ⁠Makes the ML model accessible without technical knowledge

---

---

## 📊 Dataset
•⁠  ⁠Publicly available *Bank Customer Churn Dataset*
•⁠  ⁠Contains customer demographic and financial information
•⁠  ⁠Binary target variable:
  - ⁠ 1 ⁠ → Customer Exited  
  - ⁠ 0 ⁠ → Customer Stayed

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ravikumar-engineer/customer-churn-ann.git

Step 2: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run Streamlit App
